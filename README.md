# 05 Third-Party APIs: Task Board

This page is a task board page. The objective of this page is to add tasks, manage the state of tasks progress and be able to view all tasks for tracking purposes.


To create a task, the Add Task button is clicked then a modal form will appear.  The form requires the following details to be entered:
Task Name, Task Due Date, and Task Description.

When a task is added, it is in a form of a task card and it will automatically appear in the To Do column.  As the user makes process with the task, the task card can be dragged and dropped to the subsequent statuses/columns (In Progress and Done).

The color of the task cards will give a visual of whether the task is within three days of the deadline or is overdue.  When the task is progressing "on time" the task card will be in green.  When the task is within three days of the deadline, the task card will be in yellow.  Lastly, when the task is overdue, the task card will be in red.

The user also has the option to Delete tasks at anytime of the task life cycle.
